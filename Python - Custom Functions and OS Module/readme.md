# Python - Custom Functions and OS Module 

## Video - https://youtu.be/6Zl8vBkKAWQ

This class will show you how to use Python to send commands to the Operating System and also allow Python to access the return from the command. This means that your Python app can gain all the functionality that exists on your Operating System

We will also learn how to create custom Functions. Functions are basically small programs within your project. This allows you to write a routine once, and then simply call it later when you need it in the script.

The class will go over:
- Sending Command to the Operating System
- Receiving the results of Commands
- Overview of Command Line apps you can access
- Building custom functions
- How function returns work

## NOTE

Diffrent Operating Systems use different commands.  This class was written on MacOS and shoudl work fine for Linux.  Windows users will have to tweak code.
