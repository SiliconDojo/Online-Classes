## Video - https://youtu.be/8R5y-0wCh1c

This class will be on the basic concepts of HTML. HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language creates the foundation of your website or web app. Using Tags you are able to build a structure for your project and from there you can add CSS and Javascript to add formatting and functionality.

HTML is a dirt simple language and is something everyone should know even if they are not "tech professionals". Just like kids in the 80's had to learn cursive, everyone now should understand HTML.

- What is HTML
- Where does HTML fit in the tech stack
- HTML 4 vs HTML 5
- How to write HTML
- How to view HTML documents
- Standard HTML Tags
- Hyperlinks
