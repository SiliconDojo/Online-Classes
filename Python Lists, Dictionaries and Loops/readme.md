# Python Intro - Lists, Dictionaries and Loops - Online Class

### Video of Class - https://youtu.be/S1jFXlKnjYo

This class will teach you about Lists and Dictionaries. Python does not have built in Arrays, but Lists and Dictionaries generally do the job you would use an Array for. (Arrays are used for higher level math in Python)

Lists act a lot like a number indexed array. You can sort the list, find min and max values and other basic tasks.

Dictionaries act like Named Key Arrays where you access the values by using the key name.

We will also explain For and While loops. For loops allow you to iterate through Lists and Dictionaries, and While loops continue until a condition is met.

The class will go over:
- Sets in Python
- Declaring Lists
- Manipulating Lists
- Declaring Dictionaries
- Manipulating Dictionaries
- Iterating through Lists and Dictionaries with For loops
- Using While loops
